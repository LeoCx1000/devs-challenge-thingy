This is a project that I want to see how it turns out. Basically like 4-6ish discord bot devs spend time working on the bot, one at a time, but with no communication. (2)

When working on the project, make sure to

- _try_ to follow pep8
- make sure all requirements are in `requirements.txt`
- keep the code readable
- follow what the previous dev did, but also add your creativity to it
